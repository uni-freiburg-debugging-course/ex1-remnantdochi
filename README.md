Detailed instructions are in the exercise sheet. Following are your checkpoints:

- [v] Implement a fuzzer
- [v] Generate *lots* of random instances with your fuzzer. Your evaluator and z3 must return the same result on generated instances
- [v] Provide detailed build instructions for your code so that we can evaluate it
>> ./ex01.sh name_for_random_input.smt2
random input will be generated
results are saved as main_ouput.txt, z3_output.txt
